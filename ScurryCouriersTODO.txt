Scurry Couriers TODO;


-Jump Sound
-Temp Intro Screen
-temporary background muzac
-Place Assets in tiled level
-Learn/Study non physics controls in
	Corgi Engine.
-dissect and separate jobreceiver into three(?) scripts
	1. a script that holds jobs on each individual delivery nominee
	2. a script that move jobs over attached to the bossy
	3. a script that checks against deliveries (attached to a "gamecontroller" object)
		3b. move job spawner to the same object

	current bugs:
	-jumps are triggering more than once due to ground detection and jumping bools
		and jump has some problems with walls (you can infinitely jump on the wall)
	-camera doesn't quite pan over perfectly all the time, the player can move
		fast enough to trigger the camera moving BACK and get into the other Room
		before the camera is done panning.  Thereby focusing the camera into a Room
		that the player IS NOT in
